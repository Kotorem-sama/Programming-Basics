# 5-5. Alien Colors #3: Turn your if-else chain from Exercise
# 5-4 into an if-elifelse chain.

# 1) If the alien is green, print a message that the player
# earned 5 points.
# 2) If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player
# earned 10 points.
# 3) If the alien is red, print a message that the player
# earned 15 points.
# 4) Write three versions of this program, making sure each
# message is printed for the appropriate color alien.

# Green version

alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("The player just earned 5 points!")
elif alien_color == 'yellow':
    print("The player just earned 10 points!")
elif alien_color == 'red':
    print("The player just earned 15 points!")

# Yellow version

alien_color = 'yellow'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("The player just earned 5 points!")
elif alien_color == 'yellow':
    print("The player just earned 10 points!")
elif alien_color == 'red':
    print("The player just earned 15 points!")
