# 6-11. Cities: Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names
# of three cities as keys in your dictionary. Create a
# dictionary of information about each city and include the
# country that the city is in, its approximate population, and
# one fact about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s
# dictionary should be something like country, population,
# and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the
# information you have stored about it.
