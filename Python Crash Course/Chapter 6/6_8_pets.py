# 6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary
# represents a different pet. In each dictionary, include the
# kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name. Store these
# dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your
# list and as you do, print everything you know about each
# pet.
