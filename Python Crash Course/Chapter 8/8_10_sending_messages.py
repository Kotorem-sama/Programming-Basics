# 8-10. Sending Messages: Start with a copy of your program
# from Exercise 8-9. Write a function called send_messages()
# that prints each text message and moves each message to a
# new list called sent_messages as itâ€™s printed. After calling
# the function, print both of your lists to make sure the
# messages were moved correctly.
