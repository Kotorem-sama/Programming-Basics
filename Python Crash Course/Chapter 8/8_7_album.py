# 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds
# a dictionary describing a music album. The function should
# take in an artist name and an album title, and it should
# return a dictionary containing these two pieces of
# information. Use the function to make three dictionaries
# representing different albums. Print each return value to
# show that the dictionaries are storing the album information
# correctly.

# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that
# allows you to store the number of songs on an album. If the
# calling line includes a value for the number of songs, add
# that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least one new
# function call that includes the number of songs on an album.
