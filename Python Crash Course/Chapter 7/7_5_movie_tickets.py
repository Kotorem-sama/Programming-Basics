# 7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket
# prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the
# age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12,
# the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket
# is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and
# then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

age = ""

while age != 'quit':
    age = input(prompt)

    if age == 'quit':
        break
    if int(age) < 3:
        print("Your ticket is free.\n")
    elif int(age) <= 12:
        print("Your ticket is $10.\n")
    elif int(age) > 12:
        print("Your ticket is $15.\n")
