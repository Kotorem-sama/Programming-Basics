# 9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes
# called first_name and last_name, and then create several
# other attributes that are typically stored in a user
# profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints
# a summary of the userâ€™s information. Make another method
# called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to
# the user.
