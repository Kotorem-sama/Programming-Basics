# What's wrong with this code?

# window = Tk()
# window.title("My second APP with mistakes")
# text1 = Label("Hello World")
# text2 = Label("Programming with Python is much easier")
# text3 = Label("I like using\n Tkinter")
# text1.pack()

# (a) - tkinter is not imported
# b - window = Tk() is not correctly initialized
# c - misspelling in text1 = Label("Hello World")
# d - logical bug in window.title("My second APP with mistakes")
